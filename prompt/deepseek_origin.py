You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses 
based on the given judging criteria.

Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User's query) and multiple 
responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [GeneralEvaluation Criteria] to 
score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other 
specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an 
overall comprehensive score upon them.

Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response 
meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example:
- Score 1: Does not meet criteria
- Score 6: Meets some parts
- Score 10: Perfectly meets criteria

#### Evaluation Criteria ####
1. Instruction Adherence:
- Fully Adhered (9-10 points): Fully complies with all instructions
   - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): Meets most instructions with minor omissions
   - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): Misses main requirements
   - Not Adhered (1-2 points): Fails completely

2. Usefulness:
   - Highly Useful (9-10 points): Comprehensive and accurate
   - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): Lacks details/accuracy
   - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): Mostly irrelevant
   - Useless (1-2 points): Completely incorrect

3. Level of Detail:
   - Very Detailed (9-10 points): Covers all aspects
   - Detailed but Lacking (6-8 points): Misses key details
   - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): Not thorough
   - Not Detailed (1-2 points): Too brief

4. Relevance:
   - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): Closely aligned
   - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): Some unnecessary info
   - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): Significant deviation
   - Not Relevant (1-2 points): Completely off-topic

You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.

Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them. The score is 0 or 1, with 1 indicating that the response is correct.

Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible.

### Evaluation Criteria ###

1. **Instruction Adherence**:
   - **Fully Adhered**: The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
   - **Partially Adhered**: The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
   - **Basically Adhered**: The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
   - **Not Adhered**: The response does not meet any instructions.
   - *Example*: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”

2. **Clarity**:
   - **Very Clear**: The response is fluent, well-structured, and logically clear.
   - **Clear but Minor Issues**: The response is mostly clear but has some minor language or structural issues.
   - **Basically Clear**: The response has noticeable language or logic issues but is still understandable.
   - **Not Clear**: The response is disjointed, illogical, and hard to understand.
   - *Example*: If the response has complex sentence structures and lacks punctuation, it falls under “Basically Clear” or “Not Clear.”

3. **Accuracy**:
   - **Completely Accurate**: All information and data are completely accurate.
   - **Mostly Accurate**: Most information is accurate, with minor errors.
   - **Some Errors**: There are some noticeable errors affecting comprehension.
   - **Mostly Incorrect**: There are numerous errors seriously affecting the credibility of the information.
   - *Example*: If a specific data point is incorrectly cited but doesn’t affect the overall conclusion, it falls under “Mostly Accurate.”

### Conversation Context ###
{conversation context & query}

### Responses to be Scored ###
[The Begin of Response]
{the response}
[The End of Response]

### Output Format Requirements ###
Output with three lines:
Specific Criteria: <Other potential criteria specific to the query and the context, and the weights of each criteria>.
Analysis: <Compare different responses based on given Criteria>.
Scores: <the overall comprehensive score of the response, e.g., \boxed{x}>.
